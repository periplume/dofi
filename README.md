## dofi: dotfile manager

dofi takes the git out of bare-repo dotfile management
- a bash script with minimal dependencies (said sorry)
- automates the creation of the local dotfile repo
- automates and assists with the creation and connection to a remote repo
- friendly and easy introduction to dotfile management with git
- hides complexity at the expense of brevity (intentional design)
- attempts to be robust, clean, clear, and reusable code
- solves a simple problem: keep my stuff safe without hassle
